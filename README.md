This is a webpage project for my csci 1101 class. It is a website that greets you with a "Welcome to CSCI 1101" message. There is a button you are prompted to click that leads you to a random,
yet interesting pdf to download, called "Are we living in a Computer Simulation?" By Nick Bostrum.
At the top, there is a navigation bar, where the "News" portal leads you to wired.com, and gives 
you the trending info on tech. The Resources page brings you to a page with a few sites to help you
self study programming. And the About page goes slightly into depth about what you can expect about
an intro to CS class.
